# SQL-Challenge
Module 9 Asignment
-----------------------------
# Instructions
-----------------------------
This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.
-----------------------------
# Technology Used
------------------------------
* PostgreSQL
# Data Modeling
--------------------------------
* Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. 
To create the sketch, feel free to use a tool like QuickDBDLinks to an external site.

# Data Engineering
-------------------------------------
1. Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Be sure to do the following:
Remember to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
For the primary keys, verify that the column is unique. Otherwise, create a composite keyLinks to an external site., which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.
Be sure to create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.
2. Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
